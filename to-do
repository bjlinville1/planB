Detail
  1st column 
    - Facility name
    - Acceptable materials
    - Hazardous: accepts?
    - Permits
    - facility statement of qualification
    - Terms & conditions
    - Additional info

# to do: raise exception if no facilities are found, and display index page without any facilities found

check whether we need to format the fields on facilities differently. everything but lat-longs & waste_type are set to String type for ease of import
